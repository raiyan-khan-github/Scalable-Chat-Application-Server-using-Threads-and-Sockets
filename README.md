# Multi-Client Socket Server in C++

This project implements a multi-client socket server using C++ and WinSock. The server can accept multiple client connections and interact with them concurrently using threads.

## Features

- Multi-client support: Handle multiple clients simultaneously.
- Real-time messaging: Clients can send and receive messages in real-time.
- Threading: Each client is managed in its own thread for efficient handling.

## Technologies Used

- **C++ Language**: The server is implemented in C++.
- **WinSock API**: For network communication and socket programming.
- **Multithreading**: Utilizing `std::thread` for concurrent client handling.
- **Data Communications**: Handles sending and receiving data over sockets.
- **Computer Networks**: Implements basic networking concepts such as sockets and IP addressing.
- **Operating Systems**: Interacts with OS-level functionalities for managing network connections and threads.
- **Problem-Solving**: Addresses various scenarios in client connection management and error handling.

## Prerequisites

- A Windows environment for WinSock support.
- C++ compiler (e.g., Visual Studio, g++).
- Basic understanding of networking concepts.
